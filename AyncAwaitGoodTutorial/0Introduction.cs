async and await are blessing for writing asynchronous functions. 

THis makes programming very easy. 
You don't have to worry about anything. 

Basic concept is Task. 
Its like normal day to day task. 
For e.g If I say to you that go and check whether Car with particular number is in parking. 
You will go then check all parking cars and match their number with number that you have. 
Then if that number matches you will come back to me and say YES. 
Then I will give you another task. 

So you are thread. 
Task is Task. 

Different tasks can be executed by same thread. 

You can create multiple tasks and store them in array. 
and execute them one by one or in parallel. 
WHen they are being executed if some task finished eearly its same thread can take some other task from list.
